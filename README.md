# Save the Rabbits

A game created during the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-3">Brackeys Game Jam 2020.1</a>. Unfortunately in the last day of game jam I was busy and did not finish a few levels with new holes/portals mechanics (the game jam theme was "Holes"), by what the game was not submitted.
